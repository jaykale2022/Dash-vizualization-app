This repository contains the component files of dash visualization app and the app has features like data insights, Category vs Maker analysis, and series trend visualization.

1) Dashboard Setup Guide:
	A.Download Zip file from my GitHub account and unzip it into a new folder.
	B.Store the styles file in a new folder (in a sub-folder with name assets).
	C.open the app.py application and run the program using any suitable python IDE( I used VS code).


2) Data Assumption
   The Y-axis of the graph represents the total registered vehicles over time as the input variable.
   The total registered vehicles are counted in millions with the time is in either yearly or quarterly sequence.

   		The fitler can have two options like Category or Maker. Upon selection of an option , the raw , particular noisy data is converted into a viusal i.e. data plot. It studies the yearly or quarterly registration data of vehicles and displays the insights over column chart.
